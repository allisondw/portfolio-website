    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Creative. Autodidact. Optimist.</h2>
    <h3>Not necessarily amazing at computers.</h3>
    <h4>But I'm learning...</h4>
    <p>I genuinely love to learn new things. Since quitting an unfulfilling job at the end of 2022, I've dedicated myself to learning everything I can about UX design, web development, and software engineering. 
        Through self-initiated projects, bootcamps, online courses, and tutorials (so many tutorials!), I've taught myself the beginnings of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Webflow, Adobe XD, Figma, ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion, and more. 
        I'm excited to be digitizing my skillset and merging my visual design and communication expertise with my growing technical abilities.
        I believe there is always a solution to any problem, you just need to turn it around and upside down and maybe shake it a few times. 
        I hope to land my first web development or software engineering role in 2024 and use my creative problem-solving skills to make positive impacts.
